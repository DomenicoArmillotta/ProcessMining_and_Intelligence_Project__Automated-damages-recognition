REPORT is composed by:

Images(convolutional feature,

Gestional Data (plate, category, driver age)

Black Box data (gps,acceleration)

## Report Components make up Report

First Missing value check is done by machine, if there are other missing values, they will be checked by a human.

#### 5.1.1. ASSUMPTIONS TO BUILD UP GATEWAYS PROBABILITIES:

5 classifiers are trained and each one is retrained 3 timed. For each training 200 tokens are requested.

For training phase 3000 tokens have been counted on 10000 total tokens (30% for training -66% for execution and 4% for monitoring).

For the window of monitoring a window of 20 classifications every 500 executions has been follows.

A new customer is inserted every 50.

10000 reports are acquired, and 3000 of them are used for training so performing under sampling a probability of have balanced data is 80/20% (in the TO BE will be 100/0).

Small companies may not have enough data report so the probability is 90/10 (in the TO BE will be 100/0).

Considering that images are taken by experts, black boxes are quite reliable, and the task of the clerk is simple so 3% of missing values above the threshold are assumed.

It's assumed that after the training of the first classifier the number of generations is faster to find so in general so 95% of "number of generations properly set" is assumed.1% probability of having a wrong radar diagram, is assumed, for each feature so we assume a 4% overall.

In the grid search 2 hyper parameters are set so different combinations of 5 possible values for the first hyperparameter are assumed and 10 for the second so 50 tries for 5 classifiers for 3 training each. Overall 7.5% probability must be in the grid search.

1) Handoff level:"Are data report balanced?" and “Is there enough data report?"were dropped since they are no more useful if report are taken from other customers of the same category.This optimization allows to save reconfigurations calls.

2) Service level: “Clerck:definition of experts' check" has been dropped since it could be easily replaced by an automatic script that could calculate priorities and then assign damage assessors to new crash images.

3) Task level: improvement of a ML Engineer's task : Evaluate Testing Report, where the cognitive effort of the Actor is reduced from 3 (apply) to 2 (understand), in this case the Engineer's aim is to check if the result is corrected or not, instead before that, he had to compute mathematic operations.

#### 6.1.1. Normative Model

<!-- - 1O 25 --  -->
![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/699c1bd12a360eb0.jpg)

Regarding normative model construction, multiple end events were converted into returns to the configure except for the last one ("Send label to Vehicle management system). This choice was taken because during log insertion in ProM multiple errors were generated related to the multiple endpoints. Moreover, from a logical point of view, configuration return was added to generate complete report since with endpoints only half reports were completely generated.Another option could have been to create a dummy end event and let all the end events converge to it.

Is important to highlight that our simulation on Bimp was performed using 300 tokens because some links with low probability were present so in the case of 100 tokens too many links has not been taken by any token.

Here the two-transition maps are compared. The two logs generated by BIMP are equal and both add two tasks (“New Report”, "Send label to Vehicle management system") more with respect to the original Normative model. To fix the transition map filters were applied to obtain

follow result.The difference between the two transition maps is the number of tokens (that we can read over the links). This is mostly caused by the fact that Apromore and Disco count tokens in two different ways. In Disco when there some loop on the number of tokens that went back and go through an activity again is added to the number of tokens who have already been there,so higher numbers w.r.t the number of tokens. In Apromore this doesn't happens, the number that can be reaf over a link is simply the number of token divided by the probability that a token go through that link. Is also highlighted that there are two loops (red circles in the Apromore's picture) and two links (red arrows in the Disco's picture) in the transition map produced with Apromore which are not present in the transition map produced with Disco.

Also, after the filtering there is some difference between the two transition maps. The same difference in the number written over the links as before (caused by the different way of counting tokens in the two software) and this time only a single loop is present (red circle in Apromore's picture) and two links (red arrows in Disco's picture) which are present in the transition map produced with Apromore but aren't in the one produced with Disco.

The created model has a high fitness, so it replays the log behaviour.

It's easy to figure out, the precisionis high, so the model guarantees to allow only minimally more behaviour than seen in the logs, so there are many constraints on the behaviour.

The generalization value which means that it will be able to reproduce future behaviour of the process.

The simplicity is not very high,which means that is similar to the starting BMPN moreover it donesn't allow to have a spaghetti like model.

In the logs, the "unobservable" (grey label) correspond to split/merge events that are not Activities.

- The first expert that is not working takes the job without the intervention of the Clerk.In this way "Clerk: definition of expert check” can be skipped.

- For customers of the same category, same number of generations of the network can be used, and activity “ML Engineer: evaluate and set number of generation of the gradient plot" can be also skipped.

- Configuration parameters set by ML Engineer (number of neurons, number of levels and threshold) are the same for customers of the same category, so no need of hyper parameterization. Under this assumption “ML Engineer: configure system" can be skipped.

Fitness is high so the model captures log behavior in a good manner. Simplicity is average, so spaghetti like model is not present, which increases readability. Since Apromore is a mining algorithm that does not belong to the class of a algorithms, a quite higher value is expected.The precision is relatively low, so it allows different behaviors from that seen in the logs, so it does not introduce any particular constraints on behavior. Generalization is high,so the model will be able to reproduce future behavior of the process.

### 6.4. PROM STATISTICS (Giuseppe Aniello,Edoardo Malaspina)

The main difference with respect to the normative model is that there are less links going back to the configuration so it can be assumed that the mined model is in general good but it suffers since the simulation, which produced the logs, has been carried out with just 300 tokens so there are some branches (especially the ones going back to the configuration) that are not enough frequent to be discovered by the mining algorithm. Since there are no more tasks than expected confirms that filtering phase was well performed. The high fitness is shown by the trace fitness of the single cases in the picture above, in which there are no skipped events.The grey events are those ones are not Activities but events like “merge" or “split” due to the presence of a lot of gateways.

- Fitness: 0.99

Simplicity:∑Hgateways+Hsequenceflows+Hactioiiies=12+38+19=69

In this case it can figure out that the Simplicity is higher w.r.t AS IS case, this is due to the introduction of violations in the log which didn't cause the removal of any task but added some gateway and some link, for example in the left part of the BPMN model mined using the modified logs we can observe that we have one more gateway and one more link with respect to the AS IS model, in the step of the “ML Engineer:configure system" we have a new link implying the fact that sometimes that step is skipped in the logs (due to the violation introduced). The generalization in the same as before while the precision dropped because now we have more variation in the logs and given the fact that those variations are not so frequent maybe the model is not well trained on them.

## 7. CONFORMANCE CHECK (Normative model + Modified Logs)

As expected, when performing conformance check between modified logs and Normative Model some skipped events are encountered. In the picture above three cases are highlighted that are those in which violations in the filtered logs were inserted.

It can figure out how other cases are normal because in that case the logs haven't been modified so there are not violations, so the logs are respected in the model.
